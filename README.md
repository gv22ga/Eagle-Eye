### Eagle Eye is a smart surveillance system to track people. 
We assume that our cameras are placed everywhere - bus stations - railway stations - everywhere! Now whenever someone goes missing,
we alert the cameras around his last known location. We send a photograph of the person to the cameras. Now the camera uses OpenCV based LBFH based
face recognizer which works offline. If the person is found, the main server is notified otherwise we increase the radius for searching.

#### Camera app
Just press the search button. It fetch the information from the server and responds automatically in real time.

#### Server app
You can add the information of missing person. If the camera find the person, then they appear in found section. You can get the screenshots of when the person was found.
And You can also nicely track the person on google map. Everything works in real time.

#### I, Rishabh and [Prakhar](https://github.com/Prakhar321) built this app for Microsoft CFD. Although we couldn't win but it was all fun!
